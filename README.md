# Basic Java Web App

This allows me to implement a basic login and authenticated service using a form system.

I was able to understand the request-response cycle in a Spring boot app. I understood how a dispatcher servlet is able to handle request, pass request to the appropriate controller which then return a string value that allows for the location of a view by the view resolver and eventually the view combined with model(in this case a hardcoded data) are then sent to the client(browser) for adequate display on a screen.
